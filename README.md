# CS 444 Fall 2020 Rohan, Ziad, and Abhinav group

Our group members are:

- Rohan Ravella
- Ziad Bekhiet
- Abhinav Madahar

Our project proposal is in `proposal.tex`.
After installing a LaTeX compiler, run `make` to build the PDF.

We will build on [Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels](https://planetrl.github.io/).
Make sure to use **Python 3.6** because this paper's code uses it.

## TODO

- [ ] Final paper
    - [x] **Rohan**    writes Prior Work section; focus on the prior work given the original paper. Make sure to add a references section using BibTeX at the end.
    - [ ] **Ziad**     writes Evaluation section; describe the techniques we will use to evaluate the model, which are the same techniques used in the original paper. Abhinav will fill in the numbers.
    - [x] **Abhinav**  writes Algorithm section
    - [x] **Rohan**  writes Introduction section
    - [x] **Rohan**  writes Conclusion section
    - [x] **Abhinav**  writes Abstract

    - [x] (by 2020-11-08) finish the proposal rough draft
        - [x] **Abhinav** gives the problem statememt: What problem (challenge) you are going to solve
        - [x] **Abhinav** gives the approach plan: How you are going to solve
        - [x] **Ziad** (after the above 2 tasks are done) gives the evaluation plan: How your are going to demonstrate whether the goal (solving the problem) is achieved or not. Visualization and analysis are important factors.
